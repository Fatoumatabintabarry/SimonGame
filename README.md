Simon Game
This project allowed me to get a little more knowledge about the Jquery library and greatly reduced the amount of typing I had to do, compared to when I used plain Javascript and a document object model. I discovered how to use Jquery commands to do basic animations. This project is a recreation of the Simon game. By producing a random number that chooses colours when the colour is chosen, a pattern is generated. A simulation demonstrates it to the user, who must then memorise his prior inputs to repeat the procedure.
Languages used are Html, Css ,Javascript and Jquery library
